# [flipdot.github.io](https://flipdot.github.io/)

This is a jekyll site made for testing github-md-editor. This is not our main
website, for that go to [flipdot.org][]!

Note to self: Links on this site are extensionless. Make sure to enable mapping
of `/SomePage` to `/SomePage.html` when deploying this on our own webserver.
See <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#extensionless-permalinks>.
