Hello!

This is a jekyll site made for testing github-md-editor. This is not our main
website, for that go to [flipdot.org][]!

[flipdot.org]: https://flipdot.org/

## ToDo

* Include the editor. Duh. Seems to be possible with submodules:
  https://help.github.com/articles/using-submodules-with-pages/

## Unresolved questions

* Add a geotag to the sites metadata?
