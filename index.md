Hello!

This is a jekyll site made for testing github-md-editor. This is not our main
website, for that go to [flipdot.org][]!

# ToDo

* Create a (responsive!) layout + design that mimics the look of [flipdot.org][]
  * Mark the section of the site you are on in the navigation
* Include the editor. Duh. Seems to be possible with submodules:
  <https://help.github.com/articles/using-submodules-with-pages/>

# Unresolved questions

* Comments!?
  * Potential solution: <https://posativ.org/isso/>
* Search?
* Add a geotag to the sites metadata?
  * Most important question of them all.
